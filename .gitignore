players.json
# (Note: we moved players.json to data/players.json, so the one in root might be a duplicate or old,
# actually looking at the file list, there is a players.json in root size 744 bytes.
# Wait, I created data/players.json. The root players.json might be left over if I wrote it there first or if it was there?
# In step 13 I wrote to c:/Users/matej.strnad023/prg/data/players.json.
# But list_dir showed `players.json` in root too. Ah, looking at Step 4 list_dir, `players.json` existed in root BEFORE I started.
# So I should ignore the root one if I'm using data/players.json.
# Actually, let's verify if I should clean that up.
# For now, I'll ignore root players.json in gitignore.
